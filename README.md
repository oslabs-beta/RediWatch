# RediWatch

The problem:
Caching provides significant performance optimization for any application, however it is difficult to confirm the efficiency of your cache. 
Also, one of the biggest problems facing developers today is how to handle cache invalidation (checking to see if the value stored in your cache matches the value in the primary source).

The solution:
An intuitive, user-friendly Website where users can log in and connect their Redis database.
Our app will utilize native Redis performance metrics along with third-party tools like Redis_Exporter to monitor and visualize users cache.
As user select different cache invalidation methods and metrics will be updated and visualized on the dashboard.
Manual and automated cache invalidation testing will be provided.
